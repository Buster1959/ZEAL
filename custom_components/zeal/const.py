# Suggested re-enable delay per heat source, in seconds - a starting point
# reflecting how each source actually behaves, not a hard rule:
#   * ASHP: long, steady, low-temp runs suit it; short-cycling wears the
#     compressor and wastes energy on defrost cycles. Longest delay.
#   * Modulating (condensing) boiler: no compressor to protect, but
#     condensing efficiency still favours steadier running over rapid
#     on/off, so a moderate delay.
#   * Non-condensing boiler: fixed high flow temp, designed to cycle on
#     and off to satisfy demand - minimal harm from re-enabling quickly.
#   * Other/unknown: fall back to the original global default.
