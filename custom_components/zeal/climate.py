"""The ZEAL room thermostat - each active room's single setpoint authority.

One ZealRoomThermostat entity is created per room that has at least one
TRV configured. It is the room's actual source of truth for its target
temperature - not any individual physical TRV. The Coordinator:

  * reads this entity's target_temperature as the room's setpoint for
    demand evaluation (see coordinator.py's _evaluate_zone), instead of
    inferring one from the room's TRVs' own raw setpoints.
  * propagates this entity's target_temperature out to every TRV
    configured for the room whenever it changes - via
    Coordinator.async_propagate_room_setpoint().
  * detects an unexpected change on any *physical* TRV in the room (a
    human adjusted it directly, not us) and both updates this entity to
    match and re-propagates to the room's other TRVs, so a manual change
    on any one TRV becomes the room's setpoint everywhere, not just on
    the TRV someone happened to touch.

This replaces an earlier "highest setpoint among the room's TRVs" default
and a separate planned-but-never-built 2-hour "boost" mechanic (see the
Decisions Log) - both were awkward substitutes for just having a real
per-room entity be the setpoint authority.

Heating only for now: hvac_modes is fixed to HEAT/OFF. Cool mode is a v2
feature contingent on a physical cooling retrofit that doesn't exist yet -
see the wiki's "V2 Future Enhancements" page for the (unbuilt, still being
designed) cooling sequence this entity will need to support later, where
it becomes the thing that puts physical TRVs into a fully-open/manual
"just a valve" state rather than driving their own setpoint.
