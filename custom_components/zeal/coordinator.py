"""Coordinator for ZEAL HVAC System.

Ports the control loop from the old `ashp_controller.py` (evaluate_floor /
set_switch) onto the new zone/room schema. Two deliberate corrections vs.
the original, both captured with their rationale in PROJECT_MANDATE.md:

  * Anti-hunting uses the **re-enable delay** (a zone switch that just
    turned OFF won't turn back ON for `DEFAULT_REENABLE_DELAY` seconds),
    not hysteresis - hysteresis was already dead code in the version of
    ashp_controller.py that was actually running.
  * The manual "hands-off this zone" override is now an integration-created
    `switch` entity per zone (see switch.py), not a hand-created
    `input_boolean` helper.

New in this schema vs. the original (which was always exactly one TRV and
one sensor per room): a room can have *multiple* TRVs and/or sensors.
  * Room temperature = the **average** of all its active sensors' readings
    (reduces single-sensor noise; standard practice for multi-sensor rooms).
  * Room setpoint = read from that room's ZealRoomThermostat entity (see
    climate.py) - a single per-room master the Coordinator treats as the
    room's actual source of truth. Physical TRVs are slaved to it: this
    Coordinator propagates the thermostat's target_temperature out to
    every TRV in the room whenever it changes, and conversely, detects an
    unexpected change on any *physical* TRV and both updates the
    thermostat to match and re-propagates to the room's other TRVs - so a
    manual adjustment on any one TRV becomes the room's setpoint
    everywhere, not just on the TRV someone happened to touch. This
    supersedes an earlier "highest setpoint among the room's TRVs" default
    and a separate planned-but-never-built 2-hour "boost" mechanic - both
    are obsolete now that there's a real per-room entity to be the
    setpoint authority instead of inferring one from N TRVs' raw states.
