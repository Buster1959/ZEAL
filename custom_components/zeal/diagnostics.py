"""Diagnostics support for ZEAL.

Answers "what is currently configured" directly from the integration's own
UI (Settings -> Devices & Services -> ZEAL HVAC System -> the "..." menu on
the integration card -> Download diagnostics) rather than requiring anyone
to inspect each Setup card or dig through debug logs. This was directly
motivated by a real
debugging session where the lack of any such view made a config mistake
(a ZealRoomThermostat entity accidentally selected as its own room's TRV,
causing infinite propagation recursion - see the Decisions Log) much
harder to spot than it needed to be.

This is HA's standard, idiomatic mechanism for "let a user see what an
integration currently holds" and complements the HTML Overview with a
portable troubleshooting document.
