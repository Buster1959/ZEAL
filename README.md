## What it does (today)

- Define **Zones** — a Zone is whatever grouping makes sense for your house (e.g.
  "Ground Floor", "First Floor"), not tied to a single Home Assistant Area.
- Assign **Rooms** to each zone — a Room is an HA Area (Kitchen, Lounge, Bedroom...).
  An Area can only belong to one zone at a time.
- Pick each zone's **heating actuator switch** — one per zone (a shared single-pump
  house might have two zones sharing conceptually different floors, a dual-pump
  house one switch per zone, a hotel one switch per level — but a zone always has
  exactly one switch).
- Pick each zone's **heat source** (ASHP, modulating/condensing boiler,
  non-condensing boiler, or other) — used to suggest a sensible starting
  **re-enable delay** for that zone (see
  [Heat sources and heating profiles](#heat-sources-and-heating-profiles)
  below), which you can then change to any value you want.
- TRVs and temperature sensors are **auto-discovered** per room from whatever's
  already assigned to that Area in Home Assistant, pre-selected, editable.
- Mark a room **active/inactive** — an unoccupied guest room, for example, can be
  excluded from heating demand without removing its configuration.
- A saved-configuration summary (zones → switch → heat source → re-enable delay
  → rooms → active TRVs/sensors) is shown after every save.
- Every room with a TRV gets its own **Thermostat** entity — the room's actual
  setpoint, not any individual physical TRV. Change it (or physically adjust any
  TRV in the room) and every TRV in that room follows automatically, kept in sync
  by the Coordinator.
- A **Coordinator** evaluates every active room every 60 seconds (and instantly on
  any tracked TRV/sensor state change), turns each zone's heating switch on when
  any active room is colder than its room Thermostat's target, and off when none
  are — with a **re-enable delay** (per zone, editable — suggested default depends
  on heat source) after switching off, so a zone can't rapidly cycle.
- If **every TRV in a zone is closed** (valve shut), the pump is forced off
  immediately regardless of temperature demand — running against a fully closed
  loop with nowhere for water to go risks dead-heading the pump. Turning back on
  once any valve reopens still respects the normal re-enable delay.
- A **battery-dead, unavailable, or stalled TRV/sensor** gets a persistent
  notification (debounced ~5 minutes to ignore brief mesh blips) naming
  exactly which entity and whether other TRVs/sensors still cover that room —
  dismissed automatically the moment it recovers. Catches Zigbee's specific
  failure mode too, not just outright unavailable: a device that's silently
  stopped reporting while its last value still looks normal (Z-Wave reliably
  marks a dead node unavailable; Zigbee doesn't). The room itself degrades
  gracefully the whole time (other sensors keep averaging, other TRVs keep
  responding, and a stalled reading is never trusted for a real decision) —
  this only adds visibility on top, it doesn't change how the room is
  controlled.
- Every setpoint is clamped to a sane 5–30°C range before it can reach a real
  TRV, logged loudly if it ever has to — a bug can't silently drive a room to
  an extreme value.
- Each zone gets a **Manual override switch** (created automatically) — turn it on
  to take that zone out of automatic control entirely.
- Each zone gets a **Demand sensor** showing `Demand` / `No demand`, with which
  rooms are asking for heat as an attribute — a quick way to see what the
  Coordinator is doing without digging through logs.

## What it doesn't do yet

- No scheduling (day/time/setpoint grid) yet — TRV setpoints are only ever *read*,
  never written by an automated timer.
- No "away mode" / holiday calendar integration yet.
- No dashboard card yet — all configuration happens through Settings → Devices &
  Services → ZEAL HVAC System → Configure.

See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for what's planned and in what order.

## Before you trust this with real heating

The Coordinator has automated and deterministic development-environment testing,
but the combined V1 scheduler and HTML setup experience still requires full live
acceptance testing. A couple of behaviours worth checking against how you actually
want your system to work:

> **📛 Pre-v1 development notice: expect to delete and recreate zones after
> updates, repeatedly, until v1 ships.** This is still actively being designed
> and tested one stage at a time — schema fields get renamed, restructured, or
> given new required values as real testing on hardware surfaces what actually
> needs to change (see the switch-field example just below, and the Decisions
> Log in the project definition doc for the full history). Some of these changes
> are backward-compatible (existing zones keep working with sensible defaults);
> others are breaking and require reopening **Configure** to reassign a field or
> just deleting and recreating the zone from scratch. **Assume the breaking kind
> until v1 is actually tagged** — don't treat a forced reconfiguration as a bug,
> and don't build anything you depend on around a specific schema shape until
> then. Each release's notes (or the project doc's Decisions Log) will say which
> kind of change happened.

- **Rooms with more than one TRV or sensor.** The original setup was always exactly
  one TRV and one sensor per room. The new schema allows several of each: room
  temperature is the **average** of all its sensors, and room setpoint is the
  **highest** setpoint among its TRVs (any one TRV wanting it warmer counts as
  demand). This is confirmed as the intended behaviour, not a placeholder — see
  `coordinator.py`'s `_room_setpoint`/`_room_temperature` methods if you want the
  detail.
- **Switch field changed 16 Aug 2026 (breaking).** From a list (`switches: [...]`,
  supporting multiple switches per zone) to a single value (`switch: <entity_id>`)
  once it was confirmed a zone only ever has one heating actuator switch in
  practice. The old list key isn't read by the new code — reopen **Configure**
  and reassign each zone's switch after updating.
- **Heat-source and re-enable-delay fields added 16 Aug 2026 (non-breaking).** An
  existing zone just behaves as ASHP-with-300s-delay until you reopen Configure
  and change it.
- **First run drives real switches.** The moment this integration is reloaded with
  zones configured, the Coordinator evaluates and acts — it doesn't wait for you to
  press a "start" button. Test with dummy/spare TRVs and switches before pointing it
  at your actual heating actuators.

## Installation

### HACS (custom repository)

This integration isn't in the default HACS store yet. Add it as a custom repository:

1. HACS → Integrations → ⋮ (top right) → **Custom repositories**.
2. Repository: this repo's URL. Category: **Integration**.
3. Find **ZEAL HVAC System** in HACS and install it.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/zeal` into your Home Assistant
   `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

All configuration is done via the UI — no YAML.

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → ZEAL HVAC System.**
   Give the integration instance a name (e.g. "ZEAL HVAC System").
2. Open **Configure** on the integration card. You'll land on the zone menu:
   - **+ Add a new zone** — creates a zone (default name "Zone N").
   - **Pick rooms** — choose which HA Areas belong to this zone.
   - **Name the zone and pick its heating switch** — rename it to something
     meaningful (e.g. "Ground Floor") and select the single switch entity it
     should control.
   - **Heat source** — pick the option that matches this zone's heating
     equipment. Not sure? See
     [Heat sources and heating profiles](#heat-sources-and-heating-profiles)
     below, or just pick "Other / not sure" — it's editable later and only
     affects the suggested value on the next screen.
   - **Re-enable delay** — pre-filled with a suggested value based on the
     heat source you just picked. Change it to whatever you want; it's your
     equipment, not a fixed rule.
   - **Per room** — review the TRVs and temperature sensors already discovered for
     that Area, untick any that shouldn't count, and toggle the room off entirely
     if it shouldn't take part in heating demand (e.g. a guest room while empty).
   - Repeat for as many zones as you have, then choose **Done → Save**.
3. Reopen **Configure** at any time to add, edit, or remove zones and rooms — every
   field is pre-filled with your current configuration.

## Heat sources and heating profiles

Every heat source — ASHP, gas boiler, oil boiler — delivers heat to your
radiators differently, and that difference matters for one specific
setting: how long a zone's switch stays off before it's allowed to turn
back on (the **re-enable delay**), which exists to stop a zone rapidly
flicking on and off.

**Air source heat pump (ASHP).** Runs at much lower flow temperatures than
a boiler (commonly 30–45°C) and modulates its output continuously rather
than switching fully on or off — it's designed for long, steady, gentle
runs. Short-cycling is genuinely harmful here: it stresses the compressor
and can force wasteful defrost cycles. **Suggested delay: 300 seconds (5
minutes).**

**Modulating / condensing boiler (gas or oil).** Adjusts its output to
roughly match how much heat the building is losing, instead of firing at
one fixed temperature. No compressor to protect, but a condensing boiler's
efficiency is *higher* at lower return temperatures — so it still runs
better satisfying demand steadily rather than being kicked on and off
rapidly. **Suggested delay: 120 seconds.**

**Older non-condensing boiler (gas or oil).** Fires at a fixed, higher
flow temperature (often 70–80°C) and has no modulation — it's built to
switch fully on, satisfy the call for heat, and switch fully off. This is
just how it's meant to work; there's little to protect by delaying a
restart. **Suggested delay: 60 seconds.**

**Other / not sure.** Falls back to the original 300-second default.

These are **starting points**, not settings baked into the heat-source
choice — the actual delay is a plain editable number, pre-filled once when
you pick a heat source and left entirely up to you from then on. If your
specific equipment's manual gives a different minimum cycle time, use
that instead.

### Requirements

- Home Assistant with at least one **Area** defined (Settings → Areas & Zones) for
  each room you want to configure.
- A `switch` entity per zone to act as the heating actuator (e.g. a smart relay or
  your ASHP's zone valve control) — exactly one per zone.
- `climate` entities (TRVs) and `sensor` entities (temperature, `device_class:
  temperature`) assigned to the relevant Areas, so they can be auto-discovered.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| 1. Skeleton integration, Config Flow, Store-backed data model | Done |
| 2. Coordinator — the actual control loop (reads TRVs/sensors, drives switches, per-zone editable re-enable delay suggested from heat source to prevent short-cycling, per-zone manual override switch, single-switch-per-zone schema) | Built with automated and deterministic development-environment coverage |
| 3. Options Flow for zone/room/TRV/sensor management | Done |
| 4. Scheduling (day/time/setpoint grid), calendar-driven away mode, multi-TRV boost/propagation on manual overrides | Model, runtime, secure panel API, Quick Change backend and audit complete; HTML UI and away mode pending |
| 5. Polish — diagnostics sensor, translations, entity icons | Diagnostics sensor and brand icon done; rest pending |
| 6. HACS store submission, including the full ZEAL rename (domain, files, repo) with a migration path for existing installs | Pending |
| 7. Adaptive schedule suggestions (learns from manual boost history, notifies rather than auto-applies) | Post-v1, planned |
| — ASHP heating + cooling (long-term goal, contingent on a physical cooling-radiator retrofit) | Schema reserved (hidden, unused), design not finalised — see project doc §10 |

## Troubleshooting

**A room's setpoint got silently changed to 5°C or 30°C, with a WARNING in
the log about a clamped out-of-range value.** As of version 0.11.0, ZEAL
actively enforces a 5–30°C sane range on every setpoint before it can reach
a real TRV — not just declared as UI metadata, genuinely blocked. If you see
this warning, something upstream produced a value outside that range; it's
worth investigating what did, since this should never happen in normal
operation. The room itself is safe either way — it got clamped to a sane
edge value, not the bad one.

**Old zone/room devices or entities still showing after a rename or removal.**
Fixed as of version 0.10.0 - versions before that never cleaned up a
device/entity when a zone or room was removed via Configure, so
renaming-by-recreating (rather than editing in place) left the old one
behind permanently. Update and restart once; existing ghost
devices/entities get cleaned up automatically on that first restart, no
manual deletion needed. If it persists on 0.10.0+, check `Settings →
Devices & Services → ZEAL HVAC System` shows exactly as many devices as
zones actually configured in Configure — if not, that's worth reporting.

**A room's Thermostat entity is stuck, or logs show a repeating stack trace
between `climate.py` and `coordinator.py`.** Fixed as of version 0.9.0 - this
was a real bug where a `ZealRoomThermostat` could end up selected as one of
its own room's TRVs (most likely if you'd assigned the thermostat entity
itself to that room's HA Area), causing it to propagate a setpoint to
itself infinitely. Update to 0.9.0+, then reopen **Configure** for the
affected room and re-save its TRV list — the entity will no longer be
offered as an option. Check `Settings → Devices & Services → ZEAL HVAC
System → ⋮ → Download diagnostics` afterward to confirm; it flags directly
whether any configured TRV is one of ZEAL's own entities. As of 0.9.1,
ZEAL's own room thermostats also display with a `[ZEAL]` suffix (e.g.
"Living Room Thermostat [ZEAL]") specifically so they're visually
distinguishable from a same-named real/dummy TRV in any entity picker —
though the actual protection against this mix-up doesn't rely on that
suffix; it's a separate, more reliable check under the hood.

**Want to see everything currently configured at a glance, not just one
zone/room at a time in Configure.** `Settings → Devices & Services → ZEAL
HVAC System → ⋮ → Download diagnostics` — a structured JSON dump of every
zone, room, TRV/sensor with live state, and each room's thermostat target
and mode. A fuller always-visible dashboard card is still planned (Milestone
4); this is the one-click version available now.

**Seeing no log output at all, even though the integration is running.** This
is expected, not broken — almost everything ZEAL logs is at `debug` level, and
Home Assistant doesn't show `debug` messages by default. Two ways to turn it on:

- **Quick, one-off (resets on restart):** `Settings → Devices & Services →
  ZEAL HVAC System → ⋮ → Enable debug logging`, then watch it live at
  `Settings → System → Logs`.
- **Persistent across restarts, for active development:** add this to
  `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    default: info
    logs:
      custom_components.zeal: debug
  ```
  Restart Core to apply it.

Once enabled, you'll see a line for every evaluation cycle, every room's
setpoint/temperature/demand decision, every TRV setpoint propagated, every
switch turned on or off, and why (delay-blocked, override active, etc.) — the
Coordinator's actual decision trace, not just errors. A full startup banner
always shows at the default log level regardless — fenced with `====` lines
so it's unmistakable where a session starts in a scrolling log, listing every
zone (whether it's actually actioned — i.e. has a switch configured), every
room's active/inactive status, TRV/sensor entity_ids, and its registered
Thermostat entity, plus the exact `manifest.json` version that produced it.
Runs once per HA restart, right after everything's finished loading — reload
the integration or restart Core, then search your log for `ZEAL starting up`
to jump straight to it.

**Options Flow shows raw keys (e.g. "name" instead of "Zone name"), stale text,
or a `formatjs MISSING_VALUE` error after an update.** Two separate issues, both
in the same area:

1. Custom integrations load `translations/en.json` at runtime, **not**
   `strings.json` — `strings.json` is just the editable source. If you edit
   `strings.json` and forget to copy the same change into
   `translations/en.json`, HA will show raw field/step keys because the file
   it actually reads never changed. Both files need to stay in sync by hand;
   there's no build step doing this automatically for a HACS-style integration.
2. Even with both files correctly in sync, Home Assistant caches a custom
   integration's translations — a config-entry *reload* alone won't pick up the
   change. Do a full HA Core **restart**, then a hard refresh of the browser tab
   (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) to clear the cached bundle.

**An Area doesn't show up as a room option.** Make sure it's defined under
Settings → Areas & Zones, and that at least one entity (TRV, sensor, or anything
else) is assigned to it — an Area with nothing in it still works as a room, but
won't have anything to auto-discover.
